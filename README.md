# Virtual Laboratory "Thermistors"

## Overview

This program was developed by **M.Ye. Kotlubaiev** under the supervision of **O.I. Lepikhov** to conduct laboratory work focused on studying the properties of thermistors, specifically their resistance changes with temperature.

## Features

- **Access Control**:
  - Before starting the lab, students must answer five questions.
  - If fewer than three questions are answered correctly, students must review the theoretical material and retake the test.

- **Theoretical Material**:
  - Provides information on thermistors to help students prepare.

- **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
  - Detailed guide for performing the laboratory work.

- **Thermistor Library**:
  - Includes 10 different thermistors with varying characteristics.
  - Provides external images, functions, and specifications for each thermistor.

- **Temperature-Dependent Resistance Simulation**:
  - Allows students to study how thermistor resistance changes with temperature, ranging from 0°C to 150°C in 5°C increments.

- **Graphical Verification of Results**:
  - Compares experimental data with theoretical data using graphs.
  - Helps identify and correct errors in student data.

- **Resistance Calculation**:
  - The program enables students to calculate the average resistivity coefficient and verifies the accuracy of the calculations.

## Technical Details

- **Programming Language**: Borland C++ Builder
- **Program Size**: Less than 5 MB
- **Compatibility**: The program is portable, does not require installation, and runs on any operating system.
